# Evidence – AC.L2-3.1.13
## Protect CUI Confidentiality During Transmission

---

## Control Overview

This document describes the evidence used to demonstrate implementation of
AC.L2-3.1.13, which requires cryptographic mechanisms to protect the
confidentiality of Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) during transmission.

This evidence supports the control response documented in the System Security Plan (SSP).

---

## Evidence Objectives

Evidence for this control demonstrates that:

- CUI is encrypted when transmitted
- Approved cryptographic mechanisms are used
- Unencrypted transmission of CUI is not permitted

---

## Evidence Artifacts

### 1. Encryption of Data in Transit

Evidence demonstrating encryption may include:

- Configuration settings enforcing encrypted network connections
- Security policies requiring encryption for CUI transmission

Examples of acceptable sources:

- TLS or HTTPS configuration settings
- Secure email or secure file transfer configurations

---

## Evidence Retention

Evidence supporting this control is retained in accordance with organizational
policy and contractual requirements and is available for review during assessment.

---

## Notes

Encryption mechanisms must protect the confidentiality of CUI whenever it is
transmitted across networks.
