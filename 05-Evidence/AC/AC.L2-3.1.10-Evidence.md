---

## Control Overview

This document describes the evidence used to demonstrate implementation of
AC.L2-3.1.10, which requires automatic session locking and pattern-hiding displays.

This evidence supports the control response documented in the System Security Plan (SSP).

---

## Evidence Objectives

Evidence for this control demonstrates that:

- User sessions automatically lock after inactivity
- Displayed information is hidden when sessions are locked
- Re-authentication is required to regain access

---

## Evidence Artifacts

### 1. Session Lock Configuration

Evidence demonstrating session locking may include:

- Endpoint or system configuration enforcing inactivity lock
- Policies requiring screen lock after defined idle periods

Examples of acceptable sources:

- Windows or macOS endpoint security settings
- Mobile or endpoint management policies

---

## Evidence Retention

Evidence supporting this control is retained in accordance with organizational
policy and contractual requirements and is available for review during assessment.

---

## Notes

Pattern-hiding is achieved when screen contents are not visible without
re-authentication.
