# Evidence – AC.L2-3.1.3
## Control the Flow of Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI)

---

## Control Overview

This document identifies evidence used to demonstrate implementation of
AC.L2-3.1.3, which requires the organization to control the flow of CUI
in accordance with approved authorizations.

This evidence supports the control response documented in the System Security Plan (SSP).

---

## Evidence Objectives

Evidence for this control demonstrates that:

- The CUI system boundary is defined
- Authorized CUI data flows are identified
- Unauthorized CUI transfers are restricted or blocked
- Users are governed by documented CUI handling requirements

---

## Evidence Artifacts

### 1. System Boundary Definition

Evidence demonstrating defined CUI boundaries may include:

- SSP section defining in-scope and out-of-scope systems
- Network or system architecture diagrams identifying CUI components
- Boundary descriptions referencing authorized interconnections

---

### 2. Authorized CUI Data Flows

Evidence demonstrating identified and approved CUI flows may include:

- Data flow diagrams showing permitted CUI paths
- Documentation describing how CUI moves between systems
- Approved workflows involving CUI processing or transmission

---

### 3. Technical Controls Restricting CUI Flow

Evidence demonstrating prevention of unauthorized CUI flows may include:

- Configuration settings restricting external file sharing
- Application or platform settings limiting data export
- Network or system controls preventing unauthorized transfers

Examples of acceptable sources:
- File sharing configuration settings
- Collaboration platform external sharing restrictions
- Application-level access controls

---

### 4. User Handling Restrictions

Evidence demonstrating user compliance requirements may include:

- CUI handling policy
- User training records referencing CUI transmission restrictions
- User acknowledgments of CUI handling rules

---

## Evidence Retention

Evidence supporting this control is retained in accordance with organizational
policy and contractual requirements and is available for review during assessment.

---

## Notes

This document identifies representative evidence artifacts.
Organizations may implement different technical solutions provided the same
objectives are met and evidence is available.
