# Evidence – AC.L2-3.1.14
## Route Remote Access Through Managed Access Control Points

---

## Control Overview

This document describes the evidence used to demonstrate implementation of
AC.L2-3.1.14, which requires remote access to be routed through managed access
control points.

This evidence supports the control response documented in the System Security Plan (SSP).

---

## Evidence Objectives

Evidence for this control demonstrates that:

- Remote access is routed through centrally managed access controls
- Access decisions are enforced by organizational policy
- Direct, unmanaged access paths are not permitted

---

## Evidence Artifacts

### 1. Managed Cloud Access Enforcement

Evidence demonstrating managed access control points may include:

- Centralized identity-based access controls governing remote access
- Device trust requirements enforced before access is granted
- Denial of access from unmanaged or non-compliant devices

Examples of acceptable sources:

- Microsoft Entra ID Conditional Access policies
- Microsoft Intune device compliance enforcement
- Google Workspace Admin Console access control policies

---

## Evidence Retention

Evidence supporting this control is retained in accordance with organizational
policy and contractual requirements and is available for review during assessment.

---

## Notes

In cloud-first environments, managed access control points are implemented
through identity, device, and access policy enforcement rather than
traditional network gateways.
