# Evidence – AC.L2-3.1.12
## Monitor and Control Remote Access Sessions

---

## Control Overview

This document describes the evidence used to demonstrate implementation of
AC.L2-3.1.12, which requires remote access sessions to be monitored and controlled.

This evidence supports the control response documented in the System Security Plan (SSP).

---

## Evidence Objectives

Evidence for this control demonstrates that:

- Remote access to the enclave is explicitly defined and controlled
- Only approved remote access methods are permitted
- Remote access is restricted to authenticated users and managed devices

---

## Evidence Artifacts

### 1. Remote Access Control Configuration

Evidence demonstrating controlled remote access may include:

- Conditional Access policies restricting access to managed devices
- Restrictions preventing access from unmanaged or unknown devices
- Configuration requiring authenticated cloud access for remote users

Examples of acceptable sources:

- Microsoft Entra ID Conditional Access device and location policies
- Microsoft Intune device compliance requirements
- Google Workspace Admin Console access and endpoint policies

---

## Evidence Retention

Evidence supporting this control is retained in accordance with organizational
policy and contractual requirements and is available for review during assessment.

---

## Notes

Remote access in cloud-based environments is controlled through identity,
device trust, and access policies rather than traditional network boundaries.
